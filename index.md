﻿VulnNet Entertainment had a bad time with their previous network which suffered multiple breaches. Now they moved their entire infrastructure and hired you again as a core penetration tester. Your objective is to get full access to the system and compromise the domain.  

- Difficulty: Medium
- Operating System: Windows

Another Windows machine. Do your best and breach it, good luck!

Note: Since this is a windows machine you _might_ need to give it up to 5 minutes to boot.
